    Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The DriverPass project was for a client that wanted a system to help users prepare for their driving tests. The system included features for scheduling practice sessions, accessing the learning materials, and tracking progress.
    
    What did you do particularly well?
I believe I did very well on Project 1, specifically by doing research about Website structure and design, and how to host websites safely which I didnt quite understand before hand, to help to be more detailed when describing the needs for the project.
 
    If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I had a choice to revise aything it would likely be my UML Sequence Diagram, I think I could have been more detailed if I had practiced them more and had a better grasp on what information was supposed to be shown.

    How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I think I kept the design simple for the average user to understand, and copied my website navigations from the way it is most popularly done, like when creating an account or if you forgot your password. I also made it so that there was quick access to the main features. It’s good to consider user needs since it makes the system more effective and enjoyable to use.

    How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I usually start by finding all the requirements, then created the wireframes and process flow diagrams. Next time, I’d try to get more feedback early on so I fully understand the needs of the system and maybe if in a resal scenario, do test with prototypes to see if the design meets real user needs.
